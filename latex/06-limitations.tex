\section{Limitations}
This work has several limitations. The evaluation is limited to a single dataset (LUNA16), a single GAN architecture (CycleGAN) and only one object detection model (YOLO11), which limits the generalizability of the findings. \\
Furthermore, the experiments are conducted on two-dimensional CT clices rather than full three-dimensional slices, neglecting inter-slice contextual information that may be relevant for pulmonary nodule detection. Additionaly, while CycleGAN-based augmentation increases appearance variability, it does not explicitly model geometric variations, which are critical for accurate object localization. \\
Lastly, the realism of GAN-generated images is not assessed by clinical experts.
