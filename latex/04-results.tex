\section{Results}
The evaluation of all four settings show the following results:

\caption{Performance comparison between baseline YOLO11 and CycleGAN-augmented training}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\hline
\textbf{Model} & \textbf{AP@0.5} & \textbf{AP@0.5:0.95} & \textbf{Mean IoU} \\
\hline
Baseline & 0.798 & 0.437 & 0.716 \\
Baseline Augmented & 0.800 & 0.442 & 0.726 \\
CycleGAN & 0.798 & 0.428 & 0.707 \\
CycleGAN Augmented & 0.805 & 0.443 & 0.713 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\noindent
Across all four settings, detection performance remains mostly consistent. The CycleGAN-augmented model have slightly higher AP@0.5 and AP@0.5:0.95 values. However, these gains are marginal and accompanied by a minor decrease in mean IoU.
