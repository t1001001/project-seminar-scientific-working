\section{Discussion}
The experimental results indicate that neither classical augmentation nor CycleGAN-based augmentation substantially improve pulmonary nodule detection performance. While CycleGAN-based augmentation introduces additional appearance diversity, this does not translate into meaningful improvements in detection performance.\\
Object detection performance relies on accurate spatial localization between images and bounding box annotations. Although CycleGAN preserves global anatomical structure, appearance-level augmentations may introduce subtle inconsistencies, limiting potential benefits for bounding box regression. As a result, CycleGAN-generated data neither significantly enhances or degrades model performance.
