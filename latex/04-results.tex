\section{Preliminary Results}
Preliminary evaluation shows the following results:
\begin{table}[H]

\caption{Performance comparison between baseline YOLO11 and CycleGAN-augmented training}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\hline
\textbf{Model} & \textbf{AP@0.5} & \textbf{AP@0.5:0.95} & \textbf{Mean IoU} \\
\hline
LUNA16 (Baseline) & 0.88 & 0.503 & 0.727 \\
LUNA16 (CycleGAN-augmented) & 0.842 & 0.474 & 0.716 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\noindent
The baseline model outperforms the CycleGAN-augmented model across all evaluated metrics. This suggests that CycleGAN-based augmentation does not improve, and may slightly degrade, object detection performance in this experimental setting. \\
\textbf{TODO: Conduct experiments on a purely synthetic dataset.}
